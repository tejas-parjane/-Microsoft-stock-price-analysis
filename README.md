Time-Series Forecasting: Predicting Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Prices 

Time-series & forecasting models
Traditionally most machine learning (ML) models use as input features some observations (samples / examples) but there is no time dimension in the data.
Time-series forecasting models are the models that are capable to predict future values based on previously observed values. Time-series forecasting is widely used for non-stationary data. Non-stationary data are called the data whose statistical properties e.g. the mean and standard deviation are not constant over time but instead, these metrics vary over time.
These non-stationary input data (used as input to these models) are usually called time-series. Some examples of time-series include the temperature values over time, stock price over time, price of a house over time etc. So, the input is a signal (time-series) that is defined by observations taken sequentially in time.



The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model
A famous and widely used forecasting method for time-series prediction is the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. ARIMA models are capable of capturing a suite of different standard temporal structures in time-series data.
